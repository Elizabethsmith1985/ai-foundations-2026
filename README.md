# building ai literacy

90 day plan, or phase one goal. understand modern AI from the ground up conceptually.  machine learning, neural networks, what is back propagation conceptually? What is gradient descent? What are transformers? What is attention? What is an LLM actually doing when it predicts? I will be learning supervised vs unsupervised learning, what a neuron is mathematically, weighted sums, activation functions, and loss functions.  

Month two I will be learning about why RRNs weren't enough, what attention is, what a transformer architecture is, what tokenization is, what pretraining means, what fine-tuning means, what inference is, and why LLMs predict next tokens. 

Month three I will be able to install python properly, use jupyter, load small datasets, train a tiny neural network, and build a simple text classifier. 

I will need phthon fluency, linear algebra intuition, neural networks mechanics, transformers and attention, how LLM's are trained (data-loss-gradient-update.)
Why I'm doing this. Because AI excites me and makes me think of all the things that can be done with it and because I want to build somthing real and solid. And because I want to make things easier for people who cant do it themselves. And because I love all the possibilities of AI.

weekly time commitment is 8 to 10 hours a week

install python. -Done

vs code and/or jupyter. -already have vs code.

pip pachages (numpy, matplotlib, pandas)

Tract two or B, at month two or three, start building tiny projects. ie: text classifier, small chatbot, data cleaning automation for local businesses, somthing that solves a real problem. automating small business spreadsheets, cleaning and analyzing datasets, writing scripts for repetitive tasks, simple chatbots for websites, resume formatting tools, scraping and organizing public data. scheduling an automation, receipt sorting, data cleaning, local reporting.  

Phase 2 month 6 to 18. 
basic hardware literacy, GPU vs CPU, memory, storage, bottlenecks, cloud compute economics.
